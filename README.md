# AthenaSquare Task

### Task Description

In this assignment, you have to create a ReactJS-based web page, in which you will be replicating the section as displayed in the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FX59nA3z2JA7OAN2CWGPYHxDI1eGKF6T/view?usp=sharing'> video </a> clip from the official website of kula.ai, which you will find attached in the mail. You just need to create a section of the website as shown in the below image and also shown in the video. Your website should look exactly like this, with just one section, and when we scroll on this action, animation happens. Please see the kula.ai website for more details.<br/>
You have to replicate the experience, animation, and design as shown in the video. You can assume the dimensions for the design and components inside it
yourself. You just need to build this specific website section as shown in the sample task video.
